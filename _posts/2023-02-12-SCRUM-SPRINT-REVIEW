The Sprint Review is an important Scrum ceremony that takes place at the end of each sprint. The primary aim of the Sprint Review is to review the work completed during the sprint and demonstrate the working software to the stakeholders. The purpose of the Sprint Review is to gather feedback from stakeholders and assess the progress made by the team during the sprint.

The Sprint Review is typically a time-boxed meeting and should last no longer than four hours for a one-month sprint. The meeting is attended by the Scrum Team, the Product Owner, the stakeholders, and anyone else who is interested in the project. The structure of a Sprint Review typically includes the following elements:

- Introduction: The Scrum Master introduces the Sprint Review and sets the context for the meeting.
- Review of Sprint Goals: The Product Owner reviews the sprint goals and explains how the work completed during the sprint has contributed to achieving those goals.
- Product Demonstration: The Scrum Team demonstrates the working software that was completed during the sprint. The demonstration should be focused on the completed work and should be easy for stakeholders to understand.
- Feedback: The stakeholders provide feedback on the work completed during the sprint. This feedback is essential for the Scrum Team to improve and adjust the product backlog for the upcoming sprint.
- Review of the Product Backlog: The Product Owner reviews the product backlog and updates it based on the feedback received from the stakeholders during the Sprint Review.
- Planning for the Next Sprint: The Scrum Team discusses the next sprint and begins the planning process.

It's important to note that the Sprint Review is not a status meeting or a planning meeting. It's a time for the Scrum Team to showcase the work they've done, gather feedback, and adjust the product backlog for the next sprint. By following the structure of the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team can ensure that they're meeting their goals and continuously improving their product.
