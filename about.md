I am a seasoned software developer with over 15 years of experience in the field. Currently, I work as a Principal Front-end Engineer at CARTO, a position I have held since November 2020. I am skilled in several programming languages and frameworks, including Vue.js, Redux.js, AngularJS, React.js, and C#.

Before my current role, I co-founded Wiber Rent a Car and worked as a full-stack developer there for four years. I have also worked as a web developer at RecordGo and as a senior analyst programmer at Omnium Strategic Intelligence SL.

I am based in Madrid, Spain, and hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the Polytechnic University of Valencia. My strong background in software development is particularly in the areas of front-end development, user interface design, and web application development.
